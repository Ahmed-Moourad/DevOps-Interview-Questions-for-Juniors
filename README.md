<details><summary>
5. What’s the difference between Public Subnet and Private Subnet?</summary><br><b>

The instances in the public subnet can send outbound traffic directly to the internet.(Via Internet Gatway).
Whereas the instances in the private subnet can't. Instead, the instances in the private subnet can access the internet by using a network address translation (NAT) gateway that resides in the public subnet.
</b></details>	

<details><summary>
6. How can an application access Internet without receiving requests from the internet?</summary><br><b>

Using NAT configured in the Routing Table.
The database servers can connect to the internet for software updates using the NAT gateway, but the internet cannot establish connections to the database servers.

## Docker Questions:

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
17. What’s the difference between container vs VM?</summary><br><b>


![image](https://github.com/Ahmed-Moourad/DevOps-Interview-Questions-for-Juniors/assets/112473376/e5eb4f75-82d4-4b39-8ac7-e5c5a428fb0d)

**VM**: uses separate OS for each VM
**Containers**:
- Use the Host OS
- Less utilization
- Your app is backed in a container and shared between environments: DEV, TEST, OPERATION
- Less size
- Fast boot up
containers abstract application layer, vm abstract os

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
18. What are Docker Image layers?</summary><br><b>

Layers are a result of the way Docker images are built. Each step in a Dockerfile creates a new “layer” that’s essentially a diff of the filesystem changes since the last step.
Metadata instructions such as LABEL and MAINTAINER do not create layers because they don’t affect the filesystem.

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
19. What’s the difference between Entrypoint and CMD?</summary><br><b>

**CMD** describes the default container parameters or commands. The user can easily override the default command when you use this.

	**ENTRYPOINT** - A container with an ENTRYPOINT is preferred when you want to define an executable.
You can only override it if you use the --entrypoint flag
entrypoint not override, CMD overwrite with before actions

	**RUN** - To run this command you will need a separate new layer and this command is mainly used to build images, and install packages and applications.

	CMD commands are ignored by Daemon when there are parameters stated within the docker run command while ENTRYPOINT instructions are not ignored but instead are appended as command line parameters by treating those as arguments of the command

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
20. What are multiple base images on Dockerfile?</summary><br><b>

	It allows you to create multiple image layers on top of the previous layers and the **AS** command provides a virtual name to the intermediate image layer. The last FROM command in the dockerfile creates the actual final image
- the idea that you have two images, the first one you build your binaries files and copy them to the second one, and the second image is the final image which from it you run your container. the first image helped you to build the second one.
- The benefits you get from this are that you built your app on a large image and the final result is a lightweight image that is on your containers.

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
21. What are types of Docker volumes?</summary><br><b>

**Named volumes** have a specific source from outside the container, for example, awesome:/bar.

	**Anonymous volumes** have no specific source, therefore, when the container is deleted, you can instruct the Docker Engine daemon to remove them.
	
	bind volumes, tmpfs volumes

	 **Types of Mount** : 
	1. Volumes
	2. Bind mounts
	3. tmpfsmounts
	4. named pipes

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
22. What are the types of Docker networks?</summary><br><b>

bridge, overlay, host, none

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
23. What’s the difference between COPY and ADD?</summary><br><b>


	**COPY** takes in a source and destination. It only lets you copy in a local or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself.
	
	**ADD** does the same but in addition, it also supports 2 other sources:
A URL instead of a local file/directory. &&&& Extract tar from the source directory into the destination.

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
24. How could you secure your Dockerfile?</summary><br><b>

	- Run the container as a non-root user. ...
	- Remove unnecessary packages/software from the image. ...

	Enable Docker Content Trust (DCT) ... Content trust is disabled by default in the Docker Client. To enable it, set the DOCKER\_CONTENT\_TRUST environment variable to 1. This prevents users from working with tagged images unless they contain a signature.
	- Use COPY instead of ADD in Dockerfile. ...
	- Do not store any secrets in Dockerfile. ...
	- Install verified packages and use trusted base images.
\-----

	1. Continuous Approach. ...
	2. Image Vulnerabilities. ...
	3. Policy Enforcement. ...
	4. Create a User for the Container Image. ...
	5. Use Trusted Base Images for Container Images. ...
	6. Do Not Install Unnecessary Packages in the Container. ...
	7. Add the HEALTHCHECK Instruction to the Container Image.
</b></details>	

<details><summary>
25. What are the Stages of DevSecOps?</summary><br><b>

To adapt, software development, maintenance, and upgrading must incorporate security awareness into each stage.

	- Plan. The planning phases of DevSecOps are the least automated with the involvement of collaboration, discussion, review, and a strategy for security analysis. ...
	- Code. ...
	- Build. ...
	- Test. ...
	- Release. ...
	- Deploy. ...
	- Operation. ...
	- Monitor.

## Linux Questions:

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
26. What’s the difference between Reverse Proxy and Web Server?</summary><br><b>


	**A web server** listens for HTTP requests and reacts to them by sending back an HTTP response.
	
	**A reverse proxy** is a web server that determines what response to make by also implementing an HTTP client. Client A makes an HTTP request to the reverse proxy. The reverse proxy makes an HTTP request to Server B.

Reverse proxies are typically implemented to help increase security, performance, and reliability.

<details><summary>
39. What’s the /dev/null directory?</summary><br><b>

The null device is typically used for disposing of unwanted output streams of a process, or as a convenient empty file for input streams. This is usually done by redirection. The /dev/null device is **a special file, not a directory, so one cannot move a whole file or directory into it with the Unix mv command**.

  
  
  
  
  

## Kubernetes Questions:

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
40. What are Kubernetes architecture components and explain them?</summary><br><b>

The main componehnts of a Kubernetes cluster include: **Nodes, Image Registry, Pods**
\-------------------------------------------
**Kubernetes Core Components: Control Plane(Master Node):**
	-  **kube-apiserver**. Provides an API that serves as the front end of a Kubernetes control plane. ...
	-  **etcd**: The key-value store where all data relating to the cluster is stored
	-  **kube-scheduler**. When a new Pod is created, this component assigns it to a node for execution based on resource requirements, policies, and ‘affinity’ specifications regarding geolocation and interference with other workloads.
	-  **kube-controller-manager**. Although a Kubernetes cluster has several controller functions, they are all compiled into a single binary known as kube-controller-manager.
\-----------------------------------------------
	**Node components include: (Worker Node)**
	- **kubelet**: Every node has an agent called kubelet. It ensures that the container described in PodSpecs is up and running properly.
	- **kube-proxy**: A network proxy on each node that maintains network nodes that allow for the communication from Pods to network sessions, whether inside or outside the cluster, using operating system (OS) packet filtering if available.
	- **container runtime**: Software responsible for running the containerized applications. Although Docker is the most popular, Kubernetes supports any runtime that adheres to the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface).
</b></details>	

<details><summary>
41. What’s the difference between Master and Worker Node?</summary><br><b>

**Worker Node**:
	- Do all the Work
	- Responsible for running the containers and doing any work assigned to them by the master node
	- Many nodes
	- Consist of **3** components: kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime

	**Master Node**:
	- Create the control plane
	- Looks after scheduling and scaling applications. maintaining the state of the cluster.
	- 1 or two nodes
	- Consist of **4** components: etcd, kube controller manager, kube-API-server, kube-schedular

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
42. What are service types?</summary><br><b>

	-  **ClusterIP** (default): Internal clients send requests to a stable internal IP address.

	-  **NodePort**: Clients send requests to the IP address of a node on one or more nodePort values that are specified by the Service.

	-  **LoadBalancer:** Clients send requests to the IP address of a network load balancer.

	-  **ExternalName**: Internal clients use the DNS name of a Service as an alias for an external DNS name.

	-  **Headless**: when you want a Pod grouping, but don't need a stable IP address.

  
	The **NodePort** type is an extension of the **ClusterIP** type. So a Service of the type NodePort has a cluster IP address.

	  

	The **LoadBalancer** type is an extension of the **NodePort** type. So a Service of type **LoadBalancer** has a cluster IP address and one or more **nodePort** values.

<details><summary>
43. What’s the difference between deployment vs DaemonSet vs StatfulSet?</summary><br><b>

- **Deployments** and ReplicationControllers are meant for stateless usage and are rather lightweight.
- **Statefulsets**: is used for Stateful applications (DB), each replica of the pod will have its own state, and will be using its own Volume.
- **DaemonSet**: is a controller similar to **ReplicaSet** that ensures that the pod runs on all the nodes of the cluster.

  

	**A Daemonset will not run more than one replica per node**. Another advantage of using a Daemonset is that, if you add a node to the cluster, then the Daemonset will automatically spawn a pod on that node, which a deployment will not do

<details><summary>
44. What’s the difference between ReplicaController and ReplicaSet?</summary><br><b>

The rolling-update command works with Replication Controllers, but won't work with a Replica Set.

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
45. What is the difference between ReplicaSet and Deployment?</summary><br><b>

	- **A ReplicaSet** ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
	- **Deployment** is a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to Pods along with a lot of other useful features.

  
</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
46. How can create a variable for your deployment and how can secure it?</summary><br><b>


	  **Secrets** can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables to be used by a container in a Pod.
Secrets can also be used by other parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the Pod.

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
47. Is it possible to create multiple containers in one pod?</summary><br><b>

YES – but better be one container/Pod
because each container should do one task so if you have 2 containers in a pod and you are near to increase one container because its service/task has a lot of traffic ... then k8s will create a new pod with two containers that the second is not doing anything so you are wasting your compute capacity.

</b></details>	

<details><summary>
48. What’s a Sidecar container?</summary><br><b>

	- Sidecar containers are containers that run along with the main container in a pod. You can define any number of sidecar containers to run alongside the main container
	- The sidecar containers can also share storage volumes with the main containers, allowing the main containers to access the data in the sidecars.
	- The primary application can run independently in one container while the sidecar hosts complementary processes and tools

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
49. What’s CustomResourcesDefination (CRD)?</summary><br><b>

API resource allows you to define custom resources. Defining a CRD object creates a new custom resource with a name and schema that you specify. The Kubernetes API serves and handles the storage of your custom resource. The name of a CRD object must be a valid DNS subdomain name

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
50. What’s kube-proxy?</summary><br><b>

a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept. kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
51. What’s the difference between liveness vs readiness vs startup probes?</summary><br><b>

**liveness**:
  **Liveness Probe**: Checks if a container is running properly and restarts it if the probe fails.
**Readiness Probe**: Checks if a container is ready to receive network traffic and delays routing until it becomes ready.
**Startup Prob**e: Checks the initial startup readiness of a container, helping differentiate slow starts from unresponsive containers.
</b></details>	

<details><summary>
52. What’s the operator of the Database?</summary><br><b>

The DB Operator eases the pain of managing PostgreSQL and MySQL instances for applications running in Kubernetes. The Operator creates databases and makes them available in the cluster via Custom Resource. It is designed to support the on-demand creation of test environments in CI/CD pipelines.

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
53. What are the static pods?</summary><br><b>

Static Pods are managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, without the API server observing them

</b></details>	
  
<details><summary>
54. What are helm and helm charts?</summary><br><b>
